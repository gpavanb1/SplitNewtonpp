Fast, Bounded, Split [Newton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton%27s_method) with [pseudo-transient continuation
](https://ctk.math.ncsu.edu/TALKS/Purdue.pdf) and [backtracking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backtracking_line_search)

## Where is this used?

Good for ill-conditioned problems where there are two different sets of systems

Particular applications include
* [Fast-Slow Reaction-Diffusion systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reaction%E2%80%93diffusion_system)
* [CFD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_fluid_dynamics) - Pressure-Velocity coupling

## What does 'split' mean?

The system is divided into multiple segments, and for ease of communication, letâ€™s refer to the first segment of variables as "outer" and the remaining as "inner".

* Holding the outer variables fixed, Newton iteration is performed recursively for the inner variables, using the sub-Jacobian associated with them, until convergence is reached.

* One Newton step is then performed for the outer variables, while the inner variables are kept fixed, using the sub-Jacobian for the outer subsystem.

* This process is repeated, alternating between solving the inner and outer subsystems, until the convergence criterion for the entire system (similar to standard Newton) is met.

### Example:

Consider a system of 5 variables, with the split locations at indices [1, 4]. This results in the following segments:

  * `a1` (variables from 0 to 1)
  * `a2 a3 a4` (variables from 1 to 4)
  * `a5` (variable at index 4)

1. First, the innermost segment `a5` is solved recursively using Newton's method while holding the variables `a1` and `a2 a3 a4`) fixed. This step is repeated until the convergence criterion for `a5` is met.

2. Next, one Newton step is taken for the segment `a2 a3 a4`, with `a5` held fixed. This step is followed by solving `a5` again till convergence.

3. This alternating process repeats: solving for `a5` until convergence, then one step for `a2 a3 a4`, and so on, until all subsystems converge.

Finally, one Newton step is performed for `a1`, with the other segments fixed. This completes one cycle of the split Newton process.

## How to install and execute?

This is a header-only library and can be most easily used with VSCode. The `tasks.json` contains the build and run commands that can be invoked directly from the IDE.

There is an example in `main.cpp` which can be compiled and executed

## How much faster is this?

For the bounded test problem with N=5000 and two split locations (at 1/3rd and 2/3rd), the C++ version is faster (even though the sparse linear solver is in C for the Python version). The comparison is as follows

| Method    | Time       | Iterations    | Time/Iteration |
|-----------|------------|---------------| -------------- |
C++ |  ~15 seconds  | 16  | <1 seconds |
Python | ~37 seconds | 33  | ~1.2 seconds |

## How to test?
You can run tests with the `gtest` framework. There is a `Bazel: Test` task in `.vscode/tasks.json` which can be used to run the tests.

The coverage reports can be generated with `llvm-cov` or `gcov` depending on the OS being used
